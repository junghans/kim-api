#
################################################################################
#
# This file defines the KIM API standard argument names and their properties
# supported by the KIM API, the list of standard particle species known to KIM,
# and a set of conventions defined by KIM that help to ensure that Models and
# Simulators are able to successfully communicate with each other.
#
# The requirements and capabilities of KIM Models and Simulators are defined in
# an accompanying plain text document referred to as a "KIM descriptor file".
#
# There are a number of line types that can occur in a KIM descriptor file:
#
#   1) Blank lines
#         These are lines containing only white-space characters.  These lines
#         are silently ignored by the KIM API.
#
#   2) Comment lines
#         These lines have a `#' as their first (non-white-space) character.
#         All other line types may end with a comment.  The beginning of such a
#         comment is indicated by the first occurrence of the `#' character.
#
#   3) Units handling line:
#         For Models, a variable `Unit_Handling' specifies whether the Model
#         can adjust its input and output to match a Simulator (`flexible') or
#         can only work with one set of units (`fixed').  This information is
#         ignored for Simulators.  At most one such line may occur in a KIM
#         descriptor file and it should be the second line in the descriptor
#         file which is not a comment or a blank line.  The line's first
#         non-white-space characters must be `Unit_Handling', followed by an
#         assignment symbol `:=' (white-space surrounding the assignment symbol
#         is ignored), followed by either `fixed' or `flexible'.
#
#         Example:
#         Unit_Handling := fixed
#
#   4) Base unit lines:
#         Five lines that describe a set of five base units from which all
#         other units are derived in a consistent way:
#
#         Unit_length      := `A' | `Bohr' | `cm' | `m' | `nm'
#         Unit_energy      := `amu*A^2/(ps)^2' | `erg' | `eV' | `Hartree' |
#                             `J' |`kcal/mol' | kJ/mol'
#         Unit_charge      := `C' | `e' | `statC'
#         Unit_temperature := `K'
#         Unit_time        := `fs' | `ps' | `ns' | `s'
#
#         The list of recognized units above may be extended in the future.
#         (The current list is based on the units used in 8 popular ab initio,
#         MC, MD and lattice dynamics codes: AMBER, CHARMM, DL_POLY, GROMACS,
#         LAMMPS, TOWHEE, VASP.)  As noted above all other units will be
#         derived from these units in a consistent manner.
#
#         Example:
#         Unit_length      := A
#         Unit_energy      := eV
#         Unit_charge      := e
#         Unit_temperature := K
#         Unit_time        := ps
#
#   5) Section lines
#         These lines identify logically distinct sections within the KIM
#         descriptor file.  All lines following a Section line, up to the next
#         Section line or end of the file, will be assigned to the indicated
#         section.  Currently, there are five sections defined by the KIM
#         standard:
#
#            * PARTICLE_SPECIES
#            * CONVENTIONS
#            * MODEL_INPUT
#            * MODEL_OUTPUT
#            * MODEL_PARAMETERS
#
#         These sections may occur in any order within a KIM descriptor file,
#         however the order given above is recommended.  A section line may
#         only occur once within a KIM descriptor file.
#
#   6) Data lines
#         These lines are used to specify the information that a Model
#         (Simulator) will provide to and require from a Simulator (Model), as
#         well as the conventions that the Model (Simulator) uses.  There are
#         currently three types of Data lines:
#
#            * Species Data lines
#               This line type defines the particle species supported by the
#               Simulator/Model and should only be used within the
#               PARTICLE_SPECIES section of the KIM descriptor file.  The line
#               consists of three white-space separated (case sensitive)
#               strings.  The three strings, in order, are as follows:
#
#                  1) Name: This string gives a unique name to the
#                           particle species.  This name is checked against
#                           the standard list in `standard.kim' (below).
#
#                  2) Type: This must be `spec'.
$
#                  3) code: This is the non-negative integer that the Model
#                           uses internally to identify the particle species.
#                           The special value of `-1' indicates that the Model
#                           will set the code value during the execution of its
#                           `model_init' function.  The value specified by a
#                           Simulator is ignored.
#
#            * Flag Data lines
#               This line type defines a convention (or flag), that can be used
#               to ensure that Models and Simulators are able to work together,
#               and should only be used within the CONVENTIONS section of the
#               KIM descriptor file.  The line consists of two white-space
#               separated (case sensitive) strings.  The two strings, in order,
#               are as follows:
#
#                  1) Name: This string gives a unique name to the convention.
#                           This name is checked against the standard list in
#                           `standard.kim' (below).
#
#                  2) Type: This must be `flag'.
#
#            * Argument Data lines
#               This line type defines a quantity that is associated with one
#               or more values that must be shared between the Model and
#               Simulator and should only be used within the MODEL_INPUT,
#               MODEL_OUTPUT, and MODEL_PARAMETERS sections of the KIM
#               descriptor file.  These are analogous to the arguments of a
#               function call.  The line consists of four white-space separated
#               (case sensitive) strings.  The values of these strings are
#               checked against the standard list in `standard.kim' (below) for
#               lines contained in the MODEL_INPUT and MODEL_OUTPUT sections of
#               the KIM descriptor file (but not for lines in the
#               MODEL_PARAMETERS section).  The four strings, in order, are as
#               follows:
#
#                  1) Name: This string gives a unique name to the argument.
#
#                  2) Type: This string defines the data-type of the associated
#                           values.  Currently there are six types:
#
#                           KIM string     C/C++ type      Fortran type
#
#                           `integer'      int             integer(c_int)
#                           `float'        float           real(c_float)
#                           `double'       double          real(c_double)
#                           `method'       void (*)()      c_funptr
#                           `pointer'      void *          c_ptr
#
#                           The first three are self-explanatory.  (Note:
#                           programmers should use the types listed above, as
#                           this will best ensure that cross language compiled
#                           code created one a single machine using a single
#                           compiler suite will work correctly together.  In
#                           particular, Fortran programmers should not use more
#                           specific types such as `integer*4' or `real*8' as
#                           these could lead to compatibility problems on some
#                           machines.)  The `method' type allows the Model
#                           (Simulator) to provide pointers to
#                           functions/subroutines that the Simulator (Model)
#                           may use to perform certain tasks at runtime.  The
#                           `pointer' type is capable of pointing to an
#                           arbitrary location in memory and is a catch-all
#                           type that can be used when none of the other types
#                           are appropriate.
#
#                  3) Unit: This string defines the physical units of the
#                           values (which must all be the same for all
#                           components of array quantities).
#                           Possible values are:
#
#                              * none
#                              * mass
#                              * length
#                              * time
#                              * energy
#                              * velocity
#                              * force
#                              * torque
#                              * temperature
#                              * pressure
#                              * stress
#                              * dynamic_viscosity
#                              * charge
#                              * dipole
#                              * electric_field
#                              * density
#
#                  4) Requirements: This string may be empty or `optional'.  An
#                                   empty string indicates that the argument is
#                                   required to be present by the
#                                   Simulator/Model (i.e., the Simulator/Model
#                                   will read from and/or write to the values
#                                   associated with this argument).  Models may
#                                   use the `optional' string.  If this is
#                                   specified for an input argument, it means
#                                   that the Model can run without receiving
#                                   this argument (but it may use it if
#                                   provided).  If specified for an output
#                                   argument, it means that the argument will
#                                   only be computed if required by the
#                                   Simulator.
#
#                  Argument Shape: The KIM API defines the "shape", rank
#                            (number of array dimensions) and extent (size of
#                            each dimension) for the values associated with the
#                            argument quantity.  This definition is provided
#                            fore each standard argument in `standard.kim'
#                            (below) in the argument's documentation.
#
#                            The format of the shape is a `[' followed by an
#                            (optional) comma separated list of integers or
#                            character strings, followed by a `]'.
#
#                            If an integer is provided it specifies the extent
#                            of the corresponding dimension.  Otherwise one of
#                            the two following strings may be used:
#
#                            `numberOfParticles' or `numberOfSpecies'
#
#                            NOTE that multi-dimensional arrays are defined as
#                            in C with the `fast-index' corresponding to the
#                            last in the list.  No conversion is necessary to
#                            use such an array in Fortran.  The Fortran
#                            programmer simply needs to define the dimensions
#                            of the array in the reverse order.  For example, a
#                            KIM Shape string [10,3] corresponds to a C array
#                            of shape [10][3] and to a Fortran array of shape
#                            (3,10).
#
#                            Providing a few examples is the best way to
#                            clearly define the meaning of the Shape string:
#
#                            * []   - This defines a scalar value (rank=0)
#
#                            * [10] - This defines a vector (rank=1) of 10
#                                     values
#
#                            * [numberOfParticles] - This defines a vector (rank=1)
#                                     of `numberOfParticles' values.
#
#                            * [numberOfSpecies] - This defines a vector
#                                     (rank=1) of `numberOfSpecies'
#                                     values.
#
#                            * [12,10,5] - This defines a three-dimensional
#                                    array (rank=3) of size 12 by 10 by 5.
#
#                            * [numberOfParticles,12,15] - This defines a three-
#                                    dimensional array (rank=3) of size
#                                    `numberOfParticles' by 12 by 15.
#
#                            * [12,numberOfParticles] - This defines a two-
#                                    dimensional array (rank=2) of size 12 by
#                                    `numberOfParticles'.

# KIM_API_Version line:
#
# This line lists the (oldest) KIM API version for which the Model or Simulator
# is known to be compatible.  The format is <MAJOR>.<MINOR>[.<PATCH>].  Some

# Documentation for neighbor list behavior
#
# For each listed particle, i, in the configuration a `full neighbor list'
# provides a list of every particle, j, that is a neighbor of particle i.
#
# Neighbor lists provided by a Simulator must contain all particles in the
# configuration within the Model's cutoff radius.  However, it is typical that
# Simulators will include, for efficiency reasons, additional particles that
# are outside the cutoff (the so-called "skin").  The Model is responsible for
# determining which particles in the neighbor list are inside its cutoff
# distance.
#
# All models need `coordinates', a full neighbor list (with data stored in the
# `get_neighObject' argument), and the `get_neigh' method supplied by the
# Simulator.

# The Model receives the number of particles, coordinates and a full neighbor
# list. The neighbor list defines the environment of each particle, from which
# the particles's energy is defined.  Any particle that has one or more
# neighbors contributes its energy to the total and those particles with zero
# neighbors do not contribute to the total energy.  The model computes the
# requested quantities using the supplied information.  For example, if energy
# and forces are requested, it will compute the total energy of all the
# particles based on their neighbor lists and the derivative of the total
# energy with respect to the positions of the particles.  This method can be
# used with codes that use padding particles to apply boundary conditions.  The
# padding particles are treated as regular particles by the Model, and it is up
# to the calling code to discard some information such as the forces on the
# padding particles and to compute the appropriate total energy from
# per-particle energies of the physical particles, or to use a modified
# neighbor list to obtain the desired values.
